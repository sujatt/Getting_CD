# CodeBook for the tidy dataset
=============================

This codebook describes, in brief, the dataset that was used by me for the project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data".

The data are available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones, and a description of the project is provided at
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

In short, the data set contains information on 30 volunteers who performed six activities (including walking, sitting, standing) while wearing 
a smartphone on their wrist. Using the accelerometer and gyroscope embedded in the phone, various motion and other related parameters
were captured.
The data set comes with the following information for a training as well as a testing data set: a list of all the features captured
by the phone and the activities (of the 6) that the subject was performing.

Of the 561 features in total, those that pertained to the averages and variances of each of these parameters (mean and standard deviations)
were analysed, and the tidier data set that ensues summarizes the averages over these variables by subject and activity label.
As a result, the size of the data set is greatly reduced.

## Variable names 
----------
The reduced dataset was created using the regular expression to filter out variables that reporeted the mean and std of 
the original feature set.
Parentheses were removed from old feature names; for example, "tBodyAcc-std()-Z" is now "tBodyAccStdZ".
This hopefully makes the variable names much easier to manipulate for analysis.

More details of the actual analysis process can be found in the R script in this repository:
